    javascript was introduced in 1995 by brendan eich 
    10days


    uses of javascript
    1) web developement
    2) mobile app development ( react native )
    3) game development
    4) server side development ( node js )
    5) desktop application development ( electron )
    6) iot- internet of things(cylon.js)


    what is js
    js is  a high level programming language that
    is used to create interactive and dynamic web pages

    js is used to add functionality to web pages

    js terms 
    highlevel-lowlevel
    programming - to interact with the machine or system 
                 to persome some task
    lighweight- easy to access and doesn't require more space

    crossplatform- support all os and browsers

    single threaded- only one thread can run at a time

    interpreter - converts highlevel to low level
                   line by line execution
                   line 1 
                   line 2 - error
                   line 3


    compiler - converts high level to low level
               all at once

               jit(just in time compilation)
    
    scripting language - can be integrated with the webpage





    html css- browseer
    javascript - javascript engine(browser)
                chrome - v8
                edge - chakra 
                safari - javascriptcore
                firefox- spidermonkey

    node js- 
    python - ide - terminal

    how js engine works
    code 
    parser- it continously checks the errors
    ast- abstract syntax tree- generating the tokens
    compilation(jit)- highlevel to lowlevel - proccess -output

    synchrnous  
    which executes immediately  

    asynchronous
    which executes parallely

    write a javascript alert in internal , external, inline 
    Create a simple JavaScript script that declares three different types of variables (var, let, and const) and prints their values to the console.
    Create variables of different data types: number, string, boolean, undefined, null, object, array, and function
    Use the typeof operator to log the type of each variable to the console



Write a JavaScript script that compares two variables 
using different comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=) and prints the results.

Write a JavaScript script that uses the ternary 
operator to determine if a number is even or odd.

Expand the script to include a ternary operation 
that checks if a user is an adult (18+) or a minor.

Grade Classification: Declare a variable score and 
set it to a value between 0 and 100.
 Use nested ternary operators to classify the score 
 into grades: A (>= 90), B (>= 75), C (>= 60), D (>= 45),
  and F (below 45). Log the grade.

 Temperature Check: Declare a variable temperature and 
 use nested ternary operators to categorize it as "Hot" (above 30), 
 "Warm" (20-30), "Cool" (10-19), and "Cold" (below 10).
  Log the result.

 Age Group: Declare a variable age and 
 use the ternary operator to classify the age into
  "Child" (0-12), "Teen" (13-19), "Adult" (20-64), 
  and "Senior" (65 and above). Log the result.

   

Task 1: Day of the Week Message
Scenario: Develop a webpage that displays a special
 message based on the current day of the week.

“Keep going!” for Tuesday.
“Halfway there!” for Wednesday.
“Almost the weekend!” for Thursday.
“Happy Friday!” for Friday.
“Enjoy your weekend!” for Saturday and Sunday.
Task:
Get the current day of the week.
Display the corresponding message.



Task 2: Traffic Light Simulation
Scenario: Simulate a traffic light system.
“Stop” if the light is red.
“Get Ready” if the light is yellow.
“Go” if the light is green.
Task:
Prompt the user to enter the color of the traffic light.
Display the corresponding action.



Task 3: Discount Calculator
Scenario: Calculate the discount based on the total purchase amount.
“No discount” if the amount is less than $50.
“5% discount” if the amount is between $50 and $100.
“10% discount” if the amount is between $101 and $200.
“15% discount” if the amount is above $200.
Task:
Prompt the user to enter the total purchase amount.
Display the discount percentage.


Task 4: Restaurant Menu
Scenario: You are developing a restaurant menu system that provides the price of a dish based on the dish name.

Task:
Assume a variable dish holds the name of the dish as a string 
(e.g.,  "Biriyani", "shawarma", "Fried rice", "veg pula").
Print the price.
```````````````````
Task 5: Simple Calculator
Scenario: You are developing a simple calculator 
that performs basic arithmetic operations.
Task:
Assume variables num1 and num2 hold two numbers,
 and operator holds the arithmetic operator 
 as a string (e.g., “+”).
Use a switch case statement to perform the operation and
 store the result in a variable result.
Print the result.
