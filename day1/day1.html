    javascript was introduced in 1995 by brendan eich 
    10days


    uses of javascript
    1) web developement
    2) mobile app development ( react native )
    3) game development
    4) server side development ( node js )
    5) desktop application development ( electron )
    6) iot- internet of things(cylon.js)


    what is js
    js is  a high level programming language that
    is used to create interactive and dynamic web pages

    js is used to add functionality to web pages

    js terms 
    highlevel-lowlevel
    programming - to interact with the machine or system 
                 to persome some task
    lighweight- easy to access and doesn't require more space

    crossplatform- support all os and browsers

    single threaded- only one thread can run at a time

    interpreter - converts highlevel to low level
                   line by line execution
                   line 1 
                   line 2 - error
                   line 3


    compiler - converts high level to low level
               all at once

               jit(just in time compilation)
    
    scripting language - can be integrated with the webpage





    html css- browseer
    javascript - javascript engine(browser)
                chrome - v8
                edge - chakra 
                safari - javascriptcore
                firefox- spidermonkey

    node js- 
    python - ide - terminal

    how js engine works
    code 
    parser- it continously checks the errors
    ast- abstract syntax tree- generating the tokens
    compilation(jit)- highlevel to lowlevel - proccess -output

    line 2 - async

    synchrnous  
    which executes immediately  

    asynchronous
    which executes parallely

    write a javascript alert in internal , external, inline 
    Create a simple JavaScript script that declares three different types of variables (var, let, and const) and prints their values to the console.
    Create variables of different data types: number, string, boolean, undefined, null, object, array, and function

Write a JavaScript script that compares two variables 
using different comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=) and prints the results.

Write a JavaScript script that uses the ternary 
operator to determine if a number is even or odd.

that checks if a user is an adult (18+) or a minor.

Grade Classification: Declare a variable score and 
set it to a value between 0 and 100.
 Use nested ternary operators to classify the score 
 into grades: A (>= 90), B (>= 75), C (>= 60), D (>= 45),
  and F (below 45). Log the grade.

 Temperature Check: Declare a variable temperature and 
 use nested ternary operators to categorize it as "Hot" (above 30), 
 "Warm" (20-30), "Cool" (10-19), and "Cold" (below 10).
  Log the result.

 Age Group: Declare a variable age and 
 use the ternary operator to classify the age into
  "Child" (0-12), "Teen" (13-19), "Adult" (20-64), 
  and "Senior" (65 and above). Log the result.
